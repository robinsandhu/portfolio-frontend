# Portfolio Website - Frontend

A Single Page Portfolio Website frontend coded in ReactJS 

<img src="screenshots/screenshot1.png" width="800"/>

## Features:
Fully reactive design that means it also works on mobile devices.

Supports Dark Mode.

Three column layout.

Uses cool 8bit components from nes.css which provides a retro theme.

It supports medium blog post embeds(custom coded) which requires using a custom proxy for bypassing the CORS. 
(For my current hosted version I am using a proxy hosted on heroku. You can check its url in the code itself.)
